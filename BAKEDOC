This document uses Bakedoc to generate PDF and Markdown output from
the markdown files in the source directory.

To create the output files, just run "make" in the root directory.

To ensure that your system has all the required dependencies, run
".oven/install-check" from root directory.

And remember, only edit the files in source/, and not the generated
Markdown, as it will be overwritten by the Makefile.
